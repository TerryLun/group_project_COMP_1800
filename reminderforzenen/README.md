# Remind.Me

#### *A reminders app that allows users to add, edit, & delete reminders by after the users sign up and log into the app*

### About the App

Remind.Me is a web app that allows users to set up text reminders for things that matter. It is designed for individuals who have a busy schedule and want to add and additional layer of accountability to their lives.
Text messages have a 98% open rate, while email has only a 20% open rate. We are leveraging this to help people stay on top of their schedules.

### Motivation

We wanted to make an app that will give people more visibility into their hectic schedules. Sending a text reminder days/hours/minutes before the start of the appointment will make a difference and eliminate the risk of missed appointments or having to rush to an appointment that was overlooked.

### Requirements
1.	The App must:
a) Create a reminder
b) Delete a reminder
c) Edit a reminder
2.	Associate Subtasks, tags and a date when the user should be reminded
3.	Persistence:
a) Create a backup of all the reminders (Export to file)
b) Import a backup of all the reminders
4.	User Authentication
5.	Use of DarkSky Weather API & HTML5 Geolocation API

### Instructions

- When you arrive to the homepage, you sign up and sign in with a specific email and password
- On the bottom-left of the page you can create a new reminder
- Fill out the form with all relevant information, including tags, subtasks, time and date to be reminded
- All reminders will be added to the left side in the form of a scrolling page to keep track of the reminders with a check box next to them
- You can edit and delete reminders
