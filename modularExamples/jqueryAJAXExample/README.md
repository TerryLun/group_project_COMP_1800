# Example of sending an AJAX request with jquery to update page without refresh

### Instructions
  1. `$ python3 -m http.server`
  2. navigate to http://localhost:8000
  3. click index.html
  4. Press button

#### Notes 
  * The python command just sets up a super basic server
  * The python command takes the place of having a nodejs file with express
  * The python server demonstrated cannot handle post requests. But for this example we use a GET request when grabbing the text from the server. So its fine.
