### About the App

... is a web app that allows users to set up text reminders for things that matter. It is designed for individuals who have a busy schedule and want to add and additional layer of accountability to their lives.
Text messages have a 98% open rate, while email has only a 20% open rate. We are leveraging this to help people stay on top of their schedules.

### Motivation

We wanted to allow people to create reminders while also checking what they can do at what time and where using the app's integrated Geolocator and Weather APIs which can affect the descision of making plans. It will allow users to be aware of what times they can make the right plans accordingly to the outside weather while also having access to a smart and responsive reminder app that allows you to prioritize your schedules accordingly.
